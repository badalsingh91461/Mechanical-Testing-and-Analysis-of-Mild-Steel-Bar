**1. Title of the Project**

Mechanical Testing and Analysis of Mild Steel Bar


**2. Introduction**

Mild steel is one of the most widely used engineering materials due to its ductility, weldability, and moderate strength. To ensure its suitability for various structural and industrial applications, it is essential to study its mechanical properties such as tensile strength, yield strength, percentage elongation, and hardness.
This project involves conducting mechanical testing on a mild steel specimen and analyzing its behavior under applied loads.
