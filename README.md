**1. Title of the Project**

Mechanical Testing and Analysis of Mild Steel Bar


**2. Introduction**

Mild steel is one of the most widely used engineering materials due to its ductility, weldability, and moderate strength. To ensure its suitability for various structural and industrial applications, it is essential to study its mechanical properties such as tensile strength, yield strength, percentage elongation, and hardness.
This project involves conducting mechanical testing on a mild steel specimen and analyzing its behavior under applied loads.


**3. Objectives**

To determine the tensile strength, yield strength, and percentage elongation of mild steel.

To study the stress-strain relationship for mild steel.

To evaluate the hardness of mild steel using standard tests.

To understand the failure characteristics of mild steel under loading.

To compare experimental results with standard values.
