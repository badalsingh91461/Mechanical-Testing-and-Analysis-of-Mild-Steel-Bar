# Experiment 1 – Tension Test

## Aim
To determine the tensile strength and mechanical properties of a specimen using a Universal Testing Machine (UTM).

## Theory
A tensile test measures the response of a material to a slowly applied uniaxial tensile load.  
- In the **elastic region**, deformation is reversible.  
- Beyond the **yield point**, permanent (plastic) deformation occurs.  
- The **ultimate tensile strength (UTS)** is the maximum stress a material can withstand.  
- Failure occurs after necking and fracture.  

## Equipment & Specimen
- Universal Testing Machine (UTM)  
- Specimens of mild steel, cast iron, or aluminum  

## Procedure
1. Measure specimen dimensions (diameter, gauge length, cross-sectional area).  
2. Mount specimen in UTM grips.  
3. Attach extensometer and zero the readings.  
4. Apply tensile load gradually in uniform increments.  
5. Record elongation, yield point, maximum load, and fracture point.  
6. After fracture, measure final dimensions (reduced diameter, final gauge length).  

## Calculations
- **Stress (σ) = Load / Original Area**  
- **Strain (ε) = Change in Length / Original Length**  
- **Young’s Modulus (E) = Stress / Strain (within elastic limit)**  
- **Yield Stress (fy)** = Stress at yield point  
- **Tensile Strength (UTS)** = Max Load / Original Area  
- **% Elongation = [(Final Length – Original Length) / Original Length] × 100**  
- **% Reduction in Area = [(Ao – A' ) / Ao] × 100**  

## Results
- Stress–strain curve plotted.  
- Key properties determined:  
  - Young’s modulus (E)  
  - Yield stress (fy)  
  - Ultimate tensile strength (UTS)  
  - % Elongation  
  - % Reduction in area  

## Conclusion
The tensile test provides fundamental material properties like elastic limit, yield point, tensile strength, ductility, and fracture characteristics. These parameters are essential for selecting materials in engineering design.
