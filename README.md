## ðŸ”¹ Experiments

### 1. Tensile Test
- **Objective:** Determine tensile strength, yield stress, Youngâ€™s modulus, % elongation, and % reduction in area.  
- **Procedure Summary:**
  - Specimen dimensions measured.
  - Loaded in Universal Testing Machine (UTM).
  - Stressâ€“strain curve plotted.
- **Key Calculations:**
  - Stress (Ïƒ = P/Aâ‚€)  
  - Strain (Îµ = Î”L/Lâ‚€)  
  - Youngâ€™s Modulus (E = Ïƒ/Îµ within elastic limit)  
  - UTS, % Elongation, % Reduction in area

### 2. Compression Test
- **Objective:** Evaluate compressive strength and deformation characteristics of the specimen.  
- **Procedure Summary:**
  - Specimen placed between UTM platens.  
  - Axial compressive load applied gradually.  
  - Load vs. deformation recorded until failure.  
- **Key Results:**
  - Compressive strength = Maximum load / Cross-sectional area  
  - Behavior studied: elastic shortening, plastic deformation, buckling (if slender specimen).

### 3. Izod Impact Test
- **Objective:** Measure material toughness under sudden loading.  
- **Procedure Summary:**
  - Notched specimen clamped vertically in impact testing machine.  
  - Pendulum hammer strikes opposite to the notch.  
  - Energy absorbed = Difference in hammer heights before and after impact.  
- **Result:** Toughness value (Joules) representing energy absorbed during fracture.

### 4. Charpy Impact Test
- **Objective:** Compare with Izod test to study toughness in a simply supported specimen.  
- **Procedure Summary:**
  - Notched specimen placed horizontally on supports.  
  - Hammer strikes opposite face at notch location.  
  - Energy absorbed calculated similarly to Izod.  
- **Result:** Toughness value (Joules) indicating resistance to sudden shock loading.
